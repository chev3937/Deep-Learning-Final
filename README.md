# Deep-Learning-Final

Final project contains a notebook for the Kaggle competition 'Aerial Cactus Identification'. (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aerial-cactus-identification/) 

Uses CNN to determine whether an aerial image contains a cactus. Though the task is relatively simple, it has broader relevance for ecosystem monitoring and land management. The ability to automatically detect vegetation in aerial imagery can support important applications in forestry, invasive species control, agricultural land use, and environmental conservation. These methods can enable large-scale assessments of ecosystem health and land cover change.


The repo also contains slides for presenting findings.
